1. Why do you use "using strict" at the top of your JS files?

The "use strict" directive enables JavaScript's strict mode which enforces stricter parsing and error handling
on the code at runtime. It also helps you write cleaner code and catch errors and bugs that might otherwise go
unnoticed.

2. What does line 3 mean?

3. What is happening on lines 5-8 and why?

These lines assigns the first element with a class equal to the string to a variable, so that you can access
and manipulate the html and css of that element
